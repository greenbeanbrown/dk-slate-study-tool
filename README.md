# dk_slate_study_tool
Python Dash app used to analyze the game theory of DraftKings users in a given contest, specifically the top professional players.

This tool allows the user to quickly get a snapshot of the amount of correlation used within lineups in a given contest, how that correlation is being constructed within the lineup, risk exposures for each contestant, distribution of lineup constructions, and other useful information that gives a much clearer picture into how professional players approach these contests.

This is a work in progress and something I will be adding to over time.
